    "What you type at the Python interactive prompt must be valid Python code for Python to understand and execute it. When you see the chevron prompt (`>>>`), Python is in a state waiting for you to input valid Python syntax. For example, `print(\"hello\")` is a valid Python statement and will result in Python printing `\"hello\"` to the screen. However, just typing `hello` without quotes or a command to execute it would result in a `NameError` unless `hello` has been defined previously as a variable or function.\n",

    "In Python, and most programming languages, the concept of a constant typically refers to a value that does not change. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Constants vs. Literals:** In the strict sense, \"98.6\" is more accurately described as a **literal** rather than a constant. A literal is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code. In your example, \"98.6\" is a floating-point literal. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Constants in Python:** Python doesn't have built-in constant types as some other languages do, but it's a convention to use all-uppercase variable names to indicate a value that should not change (e.g., `MAX_SIZE = 100`). This a common practice in Python to signal to other developers that this value should not be changed. While Python does not enforce immutability on these so-called \"constants,\" the uppercase naming convention serves as a strong hint.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Variables and Objects:** In Python, everything is an object, including numbers, strings, functions, and classes. When you use a literal in Python, like `98.6`, Python creates an object to represent that value. So, `98.6` is indeed an object of type `float`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Naming and Variables:** Since \"98.6\" doesn't have a name associated with it in the provided code, it isn't referred to as a variable. A variable in programming is a name that refers to a location in memory containing a value. If we were to write `temperature = 98.6`, `temperature` would be the variable name referring to the `98.6` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a more technical standpoint, considering Pythonâ€™s treatment of data, \"98.6\" is a floating-point literal representing a float object, and such literals can be thought of as the most basic form of constants in the absence of a variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, when you're working with a literal like `98.6`, under the hood, Python indeed creates a floating-point object to represent this value. This object has a unique identity (which you can see with the `id()` function), a type (`float` in this case), and a value (`98.6`). This is consistent with Python's everything-is-an-object model, where even simple values are treated as objects, each with its own identity. Every object in Python, regardless of whether it's bound to a variable name, is stored in memory, and Python maintains a reference to it. The literal `98.6` is no exception; it's just that without a variable name, this reference isn't directly accessible in the way a named variable would be. This behavior underpins Python's dynamic and high-level nature, allowing for flexible and powerful programming paradigms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring to \"98.6\" as a literal is indeed more precise in this context."
